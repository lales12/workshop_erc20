# Create custom ERC 20 from the scratch

These project is a workshop to understand the main solidity concepts using real uses cases. Our purpose is create a functional ERC20 from the scratch.

On each steep we explain a new concept and we try to add these concept to the previous smart contract to achieve our objective. Each of these step will be on separate branch to get some checkpoints, on any moment we can checkout between checkpoints.

We can change between checkpoints:

```
git checkout CHECK_POINT_TITLE
```

## 0_SKELETON

In these chapter we are going to create a empty smart contract and try to understand the following concepts:

-   Solidity version
-   Constructor
-   Contract address
-   Sender address

## 1_STORE_DATA

In these chapter we start to store some data on the smart contract and retrieve these data:

-   Basic data types (int, uint, address, bool)
-   Constants
-   Control structures (if, for, while, break, ternary operator)

## 2_MODIFIERS

One of the most important concepts on the solidity is control the access to some of the functionalities.

-   Function types (view, pure, payable, modifier, fallback)
-   modifier

## 3_ADVANCED_STORE_DATA

In these chapter we are going to learn how create complex data structures and how to use:

-   Advanced data types (array, struct, mapping)
-   Control advanced data type (instantiation)
